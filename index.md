# Museum Management Compendium

Project Management for Museums

## Intro
This page will give you a basic start up guide to managing museum projects. The document borrows from the standard Project Management processes but applies them to museums that may have their own challenges separate from corporate projects. 
It is common in arts management for one or two people to carry the torch for the entire project leading to documentation that is full of gaps but also severe burn out for the staff member. The hope is that we can remedy or resolve some of these problems. 


The basic processes of PROJECT MANAGEMENT can be comfortably adapted to museum projects. 

Project Charter > Planning > Execution > Monitoring and Controlling > Closing 

If the project team or member is able to perceive their work in smaller projects the tasks become less overwhelming and gives them a chance to view the work as separate projects. This page is primarily based on the writer's experience as managing new/upcoming projects in various stages. 

There are some basic technical definitions available for the terms that have been used. These will be linked/cited for your reference.  

## Project Charter

The project charter is the primary document that captures the details of the project. It is the right stage to define the vision and the mission of the project. This is also the document where details of the stakeholders and other workings like overall project costs and timeline can be marked tentatively. 

Note: Museum projects are of course high on social impact and almost always not concerned with monetary returns. However, in today's scenario it is prudent to have some basic monetary and funding details in place to make sure the project is sustainable and does not get shelved. It is also a great way to share with patrons and funders the philanthropic/social impact of the project.

## Planning

As an arts manager you will find that on many occasions your journey starts here. You could be new to the organisation or the trust/steering committee has already created a project charter. However, it is best to read through and question the document if the need arises. The project charter must be the base point for all your project planning. 

Create a simple master document that will serve as a ready recokener for all information about the project. Constant updation and management of the master planning document will serve as a baseline.
