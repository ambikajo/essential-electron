## Introduction
This page will act as a basic start up guide to managing museum projects. The document borrows from the standard Project Management processes but applies them to museums that may have their own challenges separate from corporate projects. 

**Note: This page is primarily based on the writer's experience as managing new/upcoming museum projects in various stages.** 

### Why is Project Management important for Museums?
Project Management processes and techniques can add clarity to the way a project is executed. It is common in arts management for one or two people to carry the torch for the entire project. This leads to documentation that is full of gaps and also severe burn out for the staff member. The hope is that we can remedy or resolve some of these problems. 

### Project Management Processes

The basic process groups of PROJECT MANAGEMENT can be comfortably adapted to museum projects. While there are no strict rules to follow, the processes will help you identify varied parts of the project you are working on. 

Initiation -> Planning -> Execution -> Monitoring and Controlling -> Closing 

There are some basic technical definitions available for the terms that have been used. These will be linked/cited for your reference [below](#process-groups).  

## Collaborative
The hope is that more people will be excited to share their thoughts and processes and help build this Compendium. 

The document is available on this [Github](https://github.com/ambikajo/museum-compendium) page, if you would like to add/edit anything please commit to the [index.md](https://github.com/ambikajo/museum-compendium/blob/gh-pages/index.md) file or email me on ambikajoshi[at]gmail[dot]com. You can also contribute by improving formats or other tips. 

Contributors will be added to the [Contributors](#contributors) section of this page.

## Initiation
This is the phase where the project vision and mission are defined. The project charter is the primary document that captures the details of the project. This is stage of the project also generates a document where details of the stakeholders and other workings like overall project costs and timeline can be marked tentatively. 

**Note: Museum projects are high on social/educational impact and almost always not concerned with monetary returns. However, in today's scenario it is imperative to have well defined impact, basic monetary and funding details in place to make sure the project is sustainable and does not get shelved. If documented properly it is also an easy way to share with patrons and funders the philanthropic/social impact of the project.**

## Planning

As an arts manager you will find that on many occasions your journey starts here. You could be new to the organization or the trust/steering committee has already created a project charter. However, it is best to read through and question the Project Charter document if the need arises. The project charter must be the base point for all your project planning. On occasion, you may need to work with the steering committee to ensure that the vision is practical in terms of the impact, timelines and costs. Naturally, this will take trust and time, so be patient but ensure you don't blindly follow a vision/mission document. 

Create a simple master document that will serve as a ready reckoner for all information about the project. Constant updating and management of the master planning document will serve as a baseline.

### Various working aspects of museum projects 
As you are the all-round staff member coordinating the museum work, there will be many things to do. Everything from content, curation, costing, design, execution, fundraising, trustee meetings, etc. will be under your aegis. 
Take time to sit with senior management and understand the goals for the project and roles of the consultants and experts contributing to the project. 
Make plans for all of these works and understand their coordination points. For example, curation and design have many overlaps, understand how the teams and consultants will coordinate and meet. As a project manager it is important for you make sure that design and curation go hand-in-hand and also support the Vision of the museum to the fullest. 

*Don't be afraid to ask your management questions that re-iterate the requirements of the project, this will help you and the management understand how the project must move forward and what are the priorities of the museum*

### Formats for scope of work and agreements 
To be added

### Formats for fundraising 
To be added

### Tips on time planning 
The strangest and possibly the most common issue of all projects  is time! One many occasions sub-projects or events that are not urgent get priority and important aspects can take a back seat. 
Always think ahead by a few days, few weeks, few months when sorting out your coordination. This will ensure you are looking at availability of funds, Human Resources and other logistic aspects. 

### Cost estimate
[Master Project Planning document]((https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qjkXnohnakZ8Tg5_rx2E0inYTxQsPoPvh5Cd6255370/edit?usp=sharing) has a section with break-ups for various aspect of curation, design and building the museum. This table will help you get concrete estimates from potential designers and vendors. 

## Execution
Execution is the most exciting and also the most complex aspect of Project Management. It is common for many aspect of the plan to change when ground realities are faced.
For the sake of museum projects execution can include entire scope of work for the designers and curators. This means that all work post the kick-off meetings of designers, curators and other creatives can be considered with the purview of execution. 
These will become sub-projects in themselves, involving a fair amount of effort and coordination. Maintain separate sub-projects for Design and Curation if you have a large-scale project. 

### Stages of Curation and Content Development

### Stages of Design 
The Design of the Exhibition spaces within the museum can be divided as below: 

#### Concept Design Document: 
The concept design for the spaces allotted in The Museum. This could be a presentation or a document. 
It will include: 

* Space allocation on a plan of the building
* Visitor flow 
* Tentative sketches
* 3D renderings
* Documented examples of exhibition techniques

#### Design Development Document:
Based on the approval of the Concept Design document, a Design Development Document will be presented. This document will include: 

- Detailed elevations, plans for all the galleries
- Schedule furniture and paint finishes
- Final samples of the graphic design panels
- Schedule for props and artefacts
- Detailed drawings for specialized furniture and displays used in the exhibits
- Schedule of exhibits and panels based on the drawings
- Coordination drawings with other consultants (if needed)
- Bill of Quantities (BoQ) for the exhibit related works
- Costing and time estimates as BoQ, as required
#### Contract Administration and Supervision of Fabrication:
Exhibition Designer will be expected:

- To conduct the bid and select the appropriate vendors for the fabrication of the Exhibit Works. The selection will be based on the budget estimates approved and the Exhibition Designerâ€™s discretion of the vendors technical capabilities.
- To conduct regular site visits to approve quality of work. 
- They will also be the approving authority on technical aspects of work stage completion before the vendors payments are cleared by the Museum.

## Definitions
### Process Groups
- **Initiating Process Group.** Those processes performed to define a new project or a new phase of an existing project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase.
- **Planning Process Group.** Those processes required to establish the scope of the project, refine the objectives, and define the course of action required to attain the objectives that the project was undertaken to achieve.
- **Executing Process Group.** Those processes performed to complete the work defined in the project management plan to satisfy the project specifications. 
- **Monitoring and Controlling Group.** Those processes required to track, review and regulate the progress and performance of the project; identify any area in which changes to the plan are required; and initiate the corresponding changes. 
- **Closing Process Group.** Those processes performed to finalize all activities across all Process Groups to formally close the project or phase.

## Automation
When managing so many aspects of the project, its important to be abreast with technology and use it to your advantage. The concept of automation can be extremely useful for Museums. Some products that can be helpful:
### [Buffer](https://buffer.com)  
Post on all social media from one platform.

### [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com)
If this then that, is a great tool to connect various services that you use.
